The independent Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen, IQWiG) examines the benefits and harms of medical interventions for patients. We provide information about the advantages and disadvantages of examination and treatment methods in the form of scientific reports and easily understandable health information.

Quality and efficiency are two deciding factors for a good and effective health care system. To achieve this aim, it is important to examine objectively the advantages and disadvantages of medical interventions for patients.

Since 2004 this has been the responsibility of the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG for short). The Institute produces independent, evidence-based reports, e.g. on:
* drugs
* non-drug interventions (e.g. surgical procedures)
* diagnostic tests and screening tests
* clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and disease management programmes (DMPs)
